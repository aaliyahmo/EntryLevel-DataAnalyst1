# EntryLevel-DataAnalyst1

##About
This was my first project for the EntryLevel Data Analyst 1 Course. It a pure visual analysis done on Excel.
There are 2 parts to this project: 
1. Analysis done on 4 different udemy courses
2. Student Mental Health analysis which was chosen by me from Kaggle.

This was completed as a report and no code was saved (unfortunately).
This was my first exposure to a data analyst course.
